# Number Plate Detection using YOLO and OCR with Tesseract

This repository contains a script for detecting number plates in images using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Tesseract.

## Overview

The script utilizes the YOLO model for object detection and Tesseract for OCR. It performs the following steps:

- Convert the image to YOLO format.
- Get predictions from the YOLO model.
- Filter detections based on confidence and probability score.
- Apply Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to eliminate overlapping bounding boxes.
- Perform OCR on the detected license plate region using Tesseract.
- Visualize the results with bounding boxes and extracted text.
- Both OCR and PYTESSERACT results are shown.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the required dependencies before running the script:

```bash
!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
```

```bash
!pip install -r ./yolov5/requirements.txt
```

## Usage
- Ensure that the YOLO model file (best.onnx) is present in the specified path (../input/cheemdur/best.onnx).
- Run the script with an image file path as an input:
```bash
python number_plate_detection.py path/to/your/image.jpg
```
## Customization
- Adjust confidence thresholds for YOLO detection and OCR based on your specific use case.
- Tune OCR parameters for better text recognition.
- Tune the script for potential modifications or improvements.
